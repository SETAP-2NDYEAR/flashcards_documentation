Objective
=========

Develop a user-friendly flashcard software tailored to the specific needs of
computer science students:
        Enable users to create, edit, and test their knowledge of coding 
        principles, algorithms, and complex concepts through flashcards.

Main Features
=============

*   Flashcard Creation and Editing :
            Users can create custom flashcards or edit pre-existing ones.

*   Self-Testing Environment :
            Allows users to test their knowledge by flipping through 
            flashcards and assessing their understanding, aiding in their 
            revision and comprehension.

*   Rating of Difficuly System :
            Enables users to rate their understanding of each flashcard,
            facilitating self-assessment and progress tracking.

*   Deck Quizzes :
            Users can test themselves on individual decks and will be 
            provided with a feedback report.

Target Audience
===============

Main Audience
-------------

Computer science students enrolled at the University of Portsmouth 
seeking to enhance their understanding of everything related to our 
course and beyond.

General Audience
------------------

Any kind of user , from any different background i.e teachers, highschool
students, professors, children.

User Experience
===============

The software will prioritise ease of use, intuitive navigation, and 
comprehensive functionality to ensure a seamless user experience.
Focus on providing interactive features that promote active learning 
and facilitate self-assessment.

Technology Stack
================

*   Utilise modern programming languages and tools ,such as Dart and
    Flutter to develop the software.
*   Implement database management systems for efficient storage and 
    retrieval of flashcard data.
